## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/family.png" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="35%" align="right"/> Hello! My name is Sonja Tapio.   
I am a student at the University of Helsinki as well as the loyal human pet of Misty and Arwen (see our family portrait on the right).  
An avid linguistical enthusiast, I speak five natural languages and have also begun to dabble in a few programming languages.  
After a long and meandering path to graduation, I have finally chosen language technology as my major, for I wish to be a part of developing future  
technologies that will improve human-human communication, regardless of what languages are being spoken.
